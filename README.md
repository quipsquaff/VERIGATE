Project Synopsis:

The Veri-Gate Software Project will utilize the aforementioned hardware and software components to design, program and configure this application to trip a relay switch. For test purposes, we will utilize a light bulb as our IOT device. This functionality will apply to any and all IOT devices that can be connected online. 

For the Minimally Viable Product, a login into the application (admin rights accessed via a MySQL table) will give the user the option to trip the relay switch. From this MVP configuration the team will work towards incorporating a facial-recognition API into the final product, thus enabling access control to specific devices based on the privileges granted to the user. One practical application of this functionality  would be parental control of sensitive information and/or technology within a household setting.
